# gestures

Hi Everyone!

This project is to use TensorFlow to predict gestures from a handheld device (imu).

I've created my training data (240 unique "instances", with a number of time periods, totalling about 6.5k lines)

I've also got my test data (to see if it works!), there's 20 unique "instances" in the test data.

I've got my code to predict values, however the trained model is running at a loss of about 0.4 which isn't good and it's not predicting correctly.

Please forgive any noob errors, I'm new and I've taught myself this over the past week.

I need some guidance on my code to see where I'm going wrong.
